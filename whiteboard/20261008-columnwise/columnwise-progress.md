# Columnwise: progress

The orchestrator's document: status, and what the threads have taught, newer than
`columnwise-plan.md` wherever the two disagree. Each worker's own account is its
`thread-<N>-<label>.md`, beside this file.

## Status

| Thread | Label | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | design note and vocabulary | landed #191 (docs only, no review) |
| 2 | entry families | underway |
| 3a | columns widen (Serial Deploy) | underway |
| 4 | removal and commit model | underway |
| 3b | column expression authoring | pending |
| 7 | `liquidize` formulary | pending |
| 6 | free regex (optional) | pending |
| 5a | folding editors | pending |
| 5b | run order in both places, row preview | pending |
| 8 | seeds pass (optional) | pending |
| 3c | columns tighten (last) | pending |

Full e2e runs carried by: (none yet).

## What the threads have taught

*Orchestrator:* the Coach answered at the start (2026-10-08): code threads start once thread 1
lands, without waiting for the Coach's read; optional threads 6 and 8 both run.

### From thread 1 (the decision record)

`notes/decisions/20261008-columnwise.md` is now the normative design: read it before the
preplan, and take its numbered decisions as settled. Those that most shape later threads
(`thread-1-cw_design.md` has all thirteen):

* **Identity is the formula's absence** (2, 3a, 3b): `$` is not identity; an emptied formula box
  removes the field. A field or top-level word has no status, so a formula always runs on it.
* **Default readout** is as the cells choose today; `markdown` for a column with a template or
  showing a `liquidize`. **Computed values reach markdown with images linked** (3b, 7).
* **A sort reads the formula's value**, never the template's text; the sheet carries the
  template's text (3b).
* **`qn` is not a ref**; **`butnot` is** (the backfill makes `question.butnot` into it), and it
  stays a view, out of the bag (3a).
* **Default params** are the family's params, each optional, flat in `config` beside
  `entry_kind`; the widgeting's params overlay them key by key (2).
* **Removal** (4): formulas, templates and `template_from.ref` naming a widgeting do not hold it
  back; only a column showing it does. Its templateable nomination goes with it.
* **Labels in general** (quiz, column, widgeting) keep an explicit button (4, 5a).
* **Reserved words** (2): the bag's top-level keys as one list *beneath* `widgeting.ts` (an import
  cycle, `quiz-bag.ts` -> `quiz.ts` -> `widgeting.ts`, forbids deriving it), held to
  `QuizBagValidators.quizBag` by a test. Global words reach **every** label (hunts, realms, quizzes,
  questions, columns, widgets, widgetings, usernames): a seeded entry widget cannot be labelled
  `number`, `text`, `boolean` or `enum`. The integrity check needs nothing new: a quiz's
  widgetings already carry the pattern. `forced_label` goes back on the list.
* *Orchestrator, ruling for thread 2:* **the importer refuses** a label a new reserved word catches,
  with a sentence naming the word (thread 1's option (a), in line with the preplan's "the integrity
  check must refuse a quiz already holding one"). The Coach greps production's raw export before
  thread 2 deploys.
* *For 3c, the Coach's call:* thread 1 suggests reserving `category` (singular) beside
  `categories`.
* A nominated `aibot` widgeting is not filled today (`filledQnOf` fills only a string value); model
  output reaches a template through a `jsonata` string over a reply, or thread 7's `template_from`.
