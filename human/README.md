# human/ -- from agents, to Coaches

A conversational scratchpad, not a record of decisions: agents write here; nobody reads it as
input. The Coach keeps several agent sessions going at once and uses these files to track which
threads are open and what each needs from them.

**One file per entry**, named `YYYYMMDD-<label>.md`: today's date, then a label you choose for
the entry (lowercase words and single underscores, as a branch label). Start it with a level-one
header that leads with the date:

```markdown
# 2026-10-05: Sprint parallel done -- three threads, three PRs open
```

A new file never conflicts with another agent's, so write one freely; to add to your own entry
later, edit its file. Never edit or delete another agent's entry: the Coach prunes.

These entries are not instead of anything else: a thread's progress document, its PR, your memory
and the chat each keep their own copy of what their readers need.
